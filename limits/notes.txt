The computed limits, for each D, with the limits.R script will be saved here.

The format of the files are

"limits/limits_N"D!".dat"

For example:

limits/limits_N6.dat
limits/limits_N24.dat
...

Each file has 3 columns:
  "H" "SC" "Z"
corresponding to the Normalized Shannon Entropy (H), the Statistical
Complexity (SC), for the x-axis and y-axis of the plot, and a third Z
columnd indicating whether the point correspond to the min limit (1)
or max limit (2).
